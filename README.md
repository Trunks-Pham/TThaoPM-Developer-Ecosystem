## Purpose

This ecosystem is built under the guiding principle:

> **“Learn by building, research by experimenting.”**

It is intended for:

* Students pursuing software engineering or computer science
* Researchers exploring real-time communication or full-stack architecture
* Self-learners aiming to sharpen their coding, design, and deployment skills

**Not for commercial use. All resources are open and intended solely for academic exploration and skill development.**

---

## Vision

To provide a comprehensive, open-source sandbox where aspiring developers can:

* Practice real-world full-stack development workflows
* Gain familiarity with real-time systems (WebSocket, WebRTC, etc.)
* Study codebases that reflect scalable software engineering patterns
* Build, break, and iterate without worrying about proprietary constraints

---

## Tech Stack

Common technologies across the ecosystem include:

* **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
* **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, REST API
* **Real-time**: WebSocket, WebRTC, Socket.IO
* **Mapping**: Leaflet, Leaflet Routing Machine
* **Authentication**: Clerk, JWT
* **Tooling**: Docker, GitHub Actions, Vite, Snowpack, ESLint
* **Deployment**: Render, Vercel, Railway
