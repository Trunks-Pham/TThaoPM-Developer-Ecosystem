# TThaoPM Ecosystem

> **Non-commercial. This ecosystem is created solely for educational and research purposes.**

A unified ecosystem of full-stack developer tools, real-time applications, and productivity utilities — built and maintained by **Pham Minh Thao** to support learning, experimentation, and scalable product development.

## Overview

The **TThaoPM Ecosystem** is a collection of open-source projects that aim to accelerate the development of modern web and mobile applications. Each project in this ecosystem is designed with modularity, reusability, and real-time functionality in mind, empowering students and developers to explore scalable full-stack systems without cost barriers.

This ecosystem is continuously evolving and welcomes feedback and contributions from fellow learners and developers.

## Projects

### 1. [tthaopm-api-tester](https://github.com/Trunks-Pham/tthaopm-api-tester)

A developer tool for testing RESTful and WebSocket APIs. It provides an intuitive interface for sending requests, viewing responses, and managing test workflows. Ideal for debugging and rapid backend development.

- Type: Utility / Dev Tool
- Technologies: TypeScript, Node.js, WebSocket, React
- Status: In Progress

---

### 2. [tthaopm-meeting](https://github.com/Trunks-Pham/tthaopm-meeting)

A lightweight real-time video calling web application built with Next.js. It supports dynamic room creation, low-latency communication, and is designed to be fully responsive across devices.

- Type: Real-time Communication
- Technologies: Next.js, WebRTC, Socket.io, Tailwind CSS
- Status: Prototype

---

### 3. [tthaopm-chat](https://github.com/Trunks-Pham/tthaopm-chat)

A real-time chat platform featuring private and public rooms, user presence tracking, typing indicators, and message history. Created as part of an effort to explore socket-based communication in full-stack systems.

- Type: Real-time Messaging
- Technologies: React, Node.js, Express, Socket.io
- Status: Beta

## Purpose

This ecosystem is built under the guiding principle:  
> **“Learn by building, research by experimenting.”**

It is intended for:
- Students pursuing software engineering or computer science
- Researchers exploring real-time communication or full-stack architecture
- Self-learners aiming to sharpen their coding, design, and deployment skills

**Not for commercial use. All resources are open and intended solely for academic exploration and skill development.**

## Vision

To provide a comprehensive, open-source sandbox where aspiring developers can:
- Practice real-world full-stack development workflows
- Gain familiarity with real-time systems (WebSocket, WebRTC, etc.)
- Study codebases that reflect scalable software engineering patterns
- Build, break, and iterate without worrying about proprietary constraints

## 🔧 Tech Stack

Across the ecosystem, the following technologies are commonly used:

- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, REST API, WebSocket
- **Real-time:** Socket.IO, WebRTC
- **Tooling:** Docker, GitHub Actions, Vite, ESLint
- **Deployment:** Render, Vercel, Railway

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome — especially ideas for improving structure, performance, and user experience. All contributions should align with the **non-commercial educational nature** of this ecosystem.
